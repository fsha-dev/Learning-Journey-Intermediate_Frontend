/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Use the pokemon API for this exercise:
       https://pokeapi.co/

    3. Create a Pokemon.jsx file and export a
       component of the same name

    4. Make it so that when the component mounts,
       you fetch the data for the pokemon 'squirtle'
       and display the following data for it in JSX:
       - name
       - image (any)
       - weight

    5. Import Pokemon in to main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it

    6. Test that it works in your Browser: you should see
       all the data above for Squirtle after a second or two
