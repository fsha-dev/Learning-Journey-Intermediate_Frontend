/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a ControlledForm.jsx file with a
       ControlledForm component and export it

    3. Make ControlledForm return:
       - text <input> for a 'name'
       - text <input> for an 'email'
       - number <input> for an 'age'
       - submit button
       Wrap all of the above in a <form> element and
       give them each a relevant 'name' attribute

    4. Create a reducer function and as well as an initial
       state variable that is an object like so:
       const initialState = { name: '', email: '', age: '' }

    5. How would you use useReducer and everything above to
       hook up the form's input values to change as you type
       in them and the values of all 3 inputs to be logged
       out to the console when you click submit?

    6. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your ControlledForm
       component and test that it works in your Browser

    BONUS* How would you clear the form on submit?
