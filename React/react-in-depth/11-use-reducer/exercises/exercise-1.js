/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a Counter.jsx file with a Counter
       component and export it

    3. Make Counter return an <h1> as well as 3
       <button> elements

    4. Create a reducer function and use useReducer
       to hook up the 3 buttons to make the counter
       go up, go down, and reset to 0. The current
       count should show in the <h1>

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your Counter
       component and test that it works in your Browser
