/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a file called useRerenderLogger.jsx
       and export a function of the same name

    3. Create a file called Home.jsx and export
       a Component of the same name

    4. Make useRerenderLogger a hook that logs out 
       "Component has mounted!" and "Component has
       re-rendered" at the appropriate times

    5. Inside Home, import and use useRerenderLogger
       to make the logs show up on mount and re-render.
       (Add whatever you need to trigger re-renders
        inside Home so you can test this)

    6. Replace <App /> with Home inside main.jsx and test
       that all this works in your Browser
