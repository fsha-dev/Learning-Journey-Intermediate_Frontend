/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create an Interval.jsx with a Interval component
       inside that you can export.

    3. Add state for a counter which is a number as well
       as an <h1> and a <button>. Have the <h1> display
       the current counter, starting at 0. When you click
       the button, increase the counter by 1.

    4. How would you setup a "setInterval" with a 1 second
       repeat to log out "Interval says hello!" ONLY ONE
       time for this component? (Changing state/re-renders
       should NOT create more or new intervals)

    5. Import Interval in to main.jsx and replace the <App />
       with it to test that it works in your Browser.
