    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a Button.jsx file that has a component
       that returns a <button /> with "Click Me!" text
       in it

    3. Make it so that when you click on the button
       "Hello there!" gets logged out to the console

    4. Export this function and replace <App /> in the
       main.jsx file with this imported Button component

    5. Check in your Browser to see if it works as expected
