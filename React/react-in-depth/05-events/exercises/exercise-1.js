/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create an Input.jsx file that has a component
       that returns an <input id="ex1" /> element

    3. Make it so that when you type in the input, you
       log out: [INPUT id=ex1]: input_value
       where input_value is the actual text inside
       the input box (on change/input)

    4. Export this function and replace <App /> in the
       main.jsx file with this imported Input component

    5. Check in your Browser to see if it works as expected
