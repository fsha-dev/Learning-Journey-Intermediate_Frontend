/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a file named Button.jsx that exports
       a component of the same name

    3. Add state to Button with useState that starts off
       as the boolean true. Have Button return a <button>
       with the text "Loading..." if the state is true
       and "Click me!" if it's false. Add an onclick to
       toggle this state between true/false.

    4. Import Button in to main.jsx and replace <App />
       with it.

    5. Test that this works in your browser by clicking
       the button to change it's text between states.
