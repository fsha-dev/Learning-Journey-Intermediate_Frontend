/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a file named Auth.jsx that exports
       a component of the same name

    3. Add state to Auth with useState that starts off
       with an empty string. Have Auth return an <input>
       for text as well as a <p> below it.

    4. Make it so the <p> displays 'Enter correct password'
       while the state is not "secret". When the text entered
       is equal to "secret", have the <p> text display
       "Successfully logged in!" instead. Change the state
       on text input on the <input> to achieve this.

    5. Import Button in to main.jsx and replace <App />
       with it.

    6. Test that this works in your browser by entering Strings
       into the <input> and finally entering "secret"
