/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a file named Button.jsx that exports
       a component of the same name

    3. Have Button take a prop named "loading". Also,
       make this component return a <button> with the
       text "Loading..." inside if the loading prop is
       true, or "Click me!" if it's false.

    4. Import Button in to main.jsx and replace <App />
       with it. Make sure to pass the loading prop in to
       Button.

    5. Test that this works in your browser by manually
       changing the prop in your code to true/false.
