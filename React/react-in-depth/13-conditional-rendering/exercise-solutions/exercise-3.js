/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a file called Names.jsx that exports
       a component of the same name

    3. Add state to Names with useState that starts off
       as an empty array. 

    4. Make Names return:
       - An <input> to type a name
       - A <button> to 'submit' the name
       - Several <p> tags, one for each name in the array

    5. The goal is to make a <p> for each name in the list
       of names in the array state. You can add to this list
       by typing a name in the <input> and clicking the submit
       <button>. However, you should ONLY show names that start
       with the letter 'A'

    6. Test that this works in your browser by addings names to
       the list starting with different letters.
