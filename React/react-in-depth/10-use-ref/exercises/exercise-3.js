/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create an Form.jsx with an Form component
       that is exported

    3. Inside Form, return a <form> with the following:
       - text input for a name
       - email input for an email
       - number input for an age
       - button with type submit and text 'Submit'
       Then, add an empty <p> tag below the <form>

    4. Find a way to use useRef such that when you submit
       the form, we display the form content in the <p>
       tag below the form in any format you like so we can
       see the information entered (and clear the form)

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your Form
       component and test that it works in your Browser
