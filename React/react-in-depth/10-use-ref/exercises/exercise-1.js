    2. Create an Video.jsx with an Video component
       that is exported

    3. Inside Video, return a <video> element with
       the src set to a video file you have locally
       (Check the vite documentation for how to import
        static asset urls)

       video it plays, and when your mouse leaves the
       video it pauses

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your Video
       component and test that it works in your Browser
