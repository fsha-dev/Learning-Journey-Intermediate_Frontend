/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create an GuessNumber.jsx with an GuessNumber component
       that is exported

    3. Inside GuessNumber, a text <input> element, a <button>
       with the text 'Guess!' inside, and an empty <p> element

    4. When the component mounts, generate a random integer/whole
       number between 1-10. Store this in a reference and do not
       render it to the DOM.

    5. Your goal is to enter a number in the text box and click
       "Guess" to guess the secret number. If you guess too high,
       the <p> should say "Too high!", if you guess too low it should
       say "Too low!" and if you guess correctly, it should say
       "You win!"

    6. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your GuessNumber
       component and test that it works in your Browser

    HINT*  console.log the number while you test

    BONUS* Make the game automatically restart a few seconds
           after you guess correctly and with a new random
           number to guess
