    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create an Input.jsx with an Input component
       that is exported

    3. Inside Input, return a text <input> element with
       a <button> below it that says "Focus"

    4. Find a way to use useRef such that when you click
       on the <button> the <input> gets focused

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with your Input
       component and test that it works in your Browser
