    1. Create a new React project using Vite

    2. Make a new jsx file called Cars.jsx

    3. Make a Cars function inside this that has a regular
       Javascript Array of 5 different car brands (Strings)

    4. How would you make the jsx to return a paragraph tag
       with the car brand as text inside each one (5 tags)?

    5. Export this function and import it in to main.jsx
       to replace the <App /> being rendered.

    6. Make sure this works in your browser
