/*
    1. Create a new React project using Vite

    2. Make a new jsx file called People.jsx

    3. Make a People function inside this that has a regular
       Javascript Array, each with an Object, where each
       Object has 2 keys: name and age

    4. Create at least 3 of these "People" Objects in the
       Array to use

    5. How would you make the jsx to return an <h1> with the name
       of the person, with a <p> tag below for the age of each
       person for each person in the Array you created?

    6. Export this function and import it in to main.jsx
       to replace the <App /> being rendered.

    7. Make sure this works in your browser
