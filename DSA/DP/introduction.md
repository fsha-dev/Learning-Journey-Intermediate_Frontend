Dude. 👏
That question shows _real_ understanding is starting — because you’re thinking **like a problem solver**, not a memorizer.
Let’s break down your thinking carefully and fix the missing piece. 💡

---

# **Problem 1**

## 🧠 What you’re doing now (and it’s very logical)

You’re thinking:

> “We just need all possible combinations of 1s and 2s that sum to `n` (the top stair).
> So we can just count how many patterns of 1s and 2s exist.”

That’s _completely valid_ reasoning — it’s exactly what the problem asks for:

> “How many **ways** can I reach step `n` using jumps of 1 or 2?”

BUT 👇
the trick is **how to systematically count all those ways**
without missing any or repeating them.

That’s where “depending on the previous step” comes in —
it’s not just math decoration, it’s _how_ we count them correctly.

---

## 💡 Let’s connect your idea and the DP idea

Let’s say `n = 4`.
You want to reach step 4.

You said:

> “I can use only 1s: [1,1,1,1]
> or only 2s: [2,2]
> or mix them: [1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,1,1] ... etc.”

Exactly ✅ — these are all valid **sequences**.

So you’re _manually_ listing all possible patterns of 1 and 2 that sum to 4.

Now imagine you had to do this for `n = 100`. 😵
You can’t list them all — you need a pattern.

---

## 🧩 That pattern = “depending on previous steps”

Instead of thinking about _every possible sequence_,
you can realize a very powerful fact:

> “Any way to reach step `n` must come from step `n-1` or step `n-2`.”

That’s not a random rule — it’s the **core pattern** in your own thinking.

Let’s test it:

To reach **step 4**, you could have:

- come from step **3** by +1, or
- come from step **2** by +2

So:

```
ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)
```

Why?
Because every valid sequence that ends at 4 **must** pass through either 2 or 3.
Those are _the only doors_ to reach 4.

That’s what “depends on previous steps” _means_.

You’re not thinking like “math recursion”,
you’re thinking like “what must I do just before the final move.”

---

## 🧩 Let’s test your mental model with a smaller case

Let’s write all the ways for each n:

| n   | All sequences (1=one step, 2=two steps)     | Count |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1   | [1]                                         | 1     |
| 2   | [1,1], [2]                                  | 2     |
| 3   | [1,1,1], [1,2], [2,1]                       | 3     |
| 4   | [1,1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,1,1], [2,2] | 5     |

Now notice the pattern in the **Count** column:

```
1, 2, 3, 5 ...
```

That’s Fibonacci.

You _discovered_ it naturally by enumerating!
DP just finds that pattern automatically using code —
so you don’t have to list them manually.

---

## ⚙️ DP turns your logic into steps

Your version (manual listing):

> “Let’s try every sequence of 1s and 2s that add to n.”

DP version (systematic logic):

> “To reach n, you can come from n−1 or n−2 → so ways(n) = ways(n−1) + ways(n−2).”

They’re the same reasoning —
DP just makes it **automatic and efficient**.

---

## 🧠 So in simple words:

| Your thinking                                | DP interpretation                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Try every pattern of 1s and 2s that sum to n | Each new step adds up previous patterns |
| 1+1+2, 2+1+1, etc.                           | ways(n) = ways(n−1) + ways(n−2)         |
| Listing manually                             | Counting dynamically                    |

So “depends on the previous step”
just means _each way to reach this step comes from smaller steps_ —
and that’s the heart of dynamic programming.

Would you like me to show a **small example (n=4)** where we literally list your “manual thinking” (all combinations)
and then show how the DP formula gets the _exact same result_ step-by-step?
